This plugin provides a simple management page for adding WalkMe code into a WordPress site. 

== Description ==

Note: This plugin is simply a WordPress integration for the WalkMe™ service. The plugin requires that you create a WalkMe™ walkthrough using their FireFox extension.

Are you looking for a way to include your WalkMe™ walkthrough in your WordPress site? Not sure how to get the code snippet into your site? Then this plugin is exactly what you need.

Just create your WalkMe™ walkthrough, publish that walkthrough, grab the code snippet, and paste it into the plugin settings in the Dashboard Tools menu. You've now included your walkthrough in your WordPress site!

You'll put WalkMe's JavaScript code into the plugin settings. The plugin will then get the content for your walkthrough from the WalkMe™ service and include it in your site.

WalkMe™ enables your business to simplify the online experience and eliminate user confusion.Think of it like a GPS, but instead of giving driving directions, WalkMe™ guides users every step of the way to successfully complete their online tasks.

A full description of the service is available at http://www.walkme.com/
